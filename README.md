# Birthday Paradox Calculator

This Python script calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in a room with *n* people. It demonstrates the counterintuitive nature of the Birthday Paradox.

## Problem Description

The Birthday Paradox states that in a group of just 23 people, there's a more than 50% chance that at least two of them share the same birthday. This is surprising because most people would intuitively expect the probability to be much lower.

The formula works by calculating the complement probability (that no two people share a birthday) and subtracting it from 1.
